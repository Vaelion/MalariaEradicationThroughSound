# MalariaEradicationThroughSound
# The Resonance Eradication Protocol

## âœ¨ Executive Summary

The Resonance Eradication Protocol is an open-source, planetary-scale strategy designed to eradicate all five known human Plasmodium species responsible for malaria â€” without chemicals, genetic modification, or ecological harm.

This living system uses harmonic resonance frequencies â€” precisely tuned to the Mortal Oscillatory Rates (MORs) of the parasites â€” to disrupt their development inside Anopheles mosquitoes. The protocol combines AI-driven targeting, drone or fixed-tower pulse emitters, and advanced safety oversight to ensure that non-target organisms and ecosystems remain unharmed.

**For all life. For the future.**
